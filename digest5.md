This article talks about 3D modeling in a more mathematical way that 3D designers can create files that represent points in space, with plenty of geometry like triangles, polygons, and curves to tie the points together into a three-dimensional object. Also, it talks about the difference between 3D modeling and 3D graphics and the results are different. In 3D graphics, the result is a 2D rendering of a 3D image or animation, like a photo of an object. In 3D modeling, however, itâ€™s a technical file that can then be used as instructions to create a tangible object. Then, it talks about how to 3D printing.

After reading this article, I knew the difference between 3D modeling and 3D graphics, and how 3D printing works.
