This article talks about 3D modeling is the process of creating a 3D representation of any surface or object by manipulating polygons, edges, and vertices in simulated 3D space. And it mentions that 3D modeling can be used in many different fields, such as engineering, entertainment, film, visual effects, game development, and commercial advertising. ALso, it talks about that the film Avatar helped to transform the 3D industry and used many of the concepts of 3D modeling. Finally, it introduces some software to create 3D modeling.

After reading this article, I think to make a good film with 3D modeling must be very difficult.
