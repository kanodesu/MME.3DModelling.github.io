This article is a quite comprehensive passage about computer graphics. It talks more about computer graphics on the image part at first. Computer graphics is much more convenient than the traditional way of painting and drawing.For example, it can change the materials or the size of your drawing very easily. Also, I knew that inside the computer, all the images we created will be stored as a series of numbers and change the numbers can change the pictures. And we can save our images in almost every computer and we can send the images to others in seconds, even that there are thousands meters between you and that person. That's a benefit of using computer graphics. What's more, this article talks about the difference between raster and vector graphics that pixels is called raster graphics and vector graphics can change size and will not look pixelated and grainy. And it also introduces how to make a 3D image or model by computer,  computer graphics can also be used for scitific use, rather than making art and CAD.

I knew more about CAD(Computer-aided design) this time. I am quite interesting in it before, because I think the speciall effects and models in sci-fi films are really amazing. I am glad that I read this article to know more about CAD, such as how to do it and what fields it can be applied.
