Briefly explain the main idea behind the technology you're researching, what is it exactly? what is it for? How does it work?
- In 3D computer graphics, 3D modeling (or three-dimensional modeling) is the process of developing a mathematical representation of any surface of an object (either inanimate or living) in three dimensions via specialized software. The product is called a 3D model. It can be displayed as a two-dimensional image through a process called 3D rendering or used in a computer simulation of physical phenomena. It usually be used in films, animations, games or architecture designs.

Who are the important people and/or organizations related to this technology? Don't just list names, briefly explain who these are and what their relationship to your research area is.
- *Charles Csuri:* He is a pioneer in computer animation and digital fine art and created the first computer art in 1964. Csuri was recognized by Smithsonian as the father of digital art and computer animation, and as a pioneer of computer animation by the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) and Association for Computing Machinery-SIGGRAPH.

- *Lumiere brothers':* They were the first to display art on the screen with special effects in their films in 1895.

- *William Higinbotham:* He created the first interactive video games, Tennis for Two.

- *William Fetter* was credited with coining the term computer graphics in 1961[1][2] to describe his work at Boeing. One of the first displays of computer animation was Futureworld (1976), which included an animation of a human face and a hand that had originally appeared in the 1972 experimental short A Computer Animated Hand, created by University of Utah students Edwin Catmull and Fred Parke.

- *Kazumasa Mitazawa* 3D computer graphics software began appearing for home computers in the late 1970s. The earliest known example is 3D Art Graphics, a set of 3D computer graphics effects, written by Kazumasa Mitazawa and released in June 1978 for the Apple II.

What are the important historical events/milestones in the development of this technology and why do they seem particularly note worthy?

- 1961  Steve Russell created a video game called Spacewar!, which was the "world's first video game".
- 1966 Ivan Sutherland invented the first computer controlled head-mounted display (HMD).This allowed the viewer to see the computer scene in stereoscopic 3D.
- 1970s The Utah teapot by Martin Newell and its static renders became emblematic of CGI development.
- 1995 Toy Story -a serious commercial rise in this era.

Draw (literally or figuratively) connections between the technology you are researching and other related technology. This could include sub-categories within your research area and/or technological predecessors and/or technology which is otherwise related to your area.

- It also connected to CGI films, 3D animation, game design, or architectural design.
