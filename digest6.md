This article talks about the uncanny valley theory. The uncanny valley means if robots will become more and more like humans and they are similar to humans to a certain degree(95%), their slight imperfections in appearance will cause anxiety in human psychology. The writer also gives a lot of films as examples to explain the uncanny valley theory, but in today's films, the characters that were made by the CG technology are still not real and films producers really need to overcome this problem in the future. What's more, the writer suggests that using CG technology in films can also save a lot of money. For example, if the film producer want to shoot a film in a castle scene, it will be much cheaper if they create the castle in 3D modeling and then apply it in films rather than build the castle in reality.

After reading this article, I understood what is the uncanny valley theory. And I knew how 3D modeling technology developed in films based on the timeline and how film producers tried to overcome the uncanny valley phenomenon in their films.
