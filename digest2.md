This article is quite similar to the first article that I read. It explains what is computer graphics and talks about images, raster and vector graphics. What's new in this article is about 3D rendering that can make the virtual scenes look more realistic in films or games. It is very complicated to rendering a good 3D model because many physical factors, such as light.

After reading this article, I knew how difficult to make a animation by computer. It reminded me that I learnt maya on my FVNMA class. It really takes a very long time to rendering those pictures to preview the model that I built. I really admire people who do animation by computer.
