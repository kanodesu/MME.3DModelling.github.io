This article talks about the background story about the world first 3D modelling and rendering object, a teapot. Yet this unassuming object—the “Utah teapot,” as it’s affectionately known—has had an enormous influence on the history of computing, dating back to 1974, when computer scientist Martin Newell was a Ph.D. student at the University of Utah. He considered many factors about the teapot, like the shapes, lighting and so on. And the teapot quickly became a beloved staple of the graphics community. Newell essentially designed the model organism of computer graphics: to graphics researchers as lab mice are to biologists.

Also, I know that something simple can become an icon of creativity .
